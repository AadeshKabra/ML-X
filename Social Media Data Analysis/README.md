The project is about Social Media Usage Data Analysis.
The dataset consists of 3 .csv files: social media visitors.csv, social_media.csv, TTL_PAGE.csv. 

Firstly, all the necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn are imported. Pandas is used for reading the dataset and converting them into dataframes. Seaborn and matplotlib are used for making graphs and plots

Then, the options for displaying the dataframes at maximum length and width are set.

The size of each of the dataset is checked, to get a rough idea about dataset. 

Some columns which have complex names are changed to a simpler names.

A scatter plot plotted below shows the distribution of daily organic reach across dates. The trend shows that there is gradual decrease in the daily organic reach.

Then, there is a bar graph which shows the organic reach across number of days.

The number of maximum monthly engaged users is 850.

Then there is a bar graph which shows the total number of daily visitors across number of days. There is a gradual increase in the number of daily visitors in the page.

Following graph shows monthly visitors on the page across the number of days. The graph shows that the trend is that there is gradual decrease in 
the monthly visitors of the page.
